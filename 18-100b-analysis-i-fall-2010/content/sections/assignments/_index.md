Collaboration on problem sets is highly encouraged, but

*   Attempt each part of each problem yourself. If you don't understand what is being asked, ask for help interpreting the problem and then make an honest attempt.
*   Write up each problem independently. Even if you have solved it in collaboration, you are expected to write the answer in your own words.
*   Write on your problem set whom you consulted and the sources you used. If you fail to do so, you may be charged with plagiarism and subject to serious penalties.
*   It is illegal to consult materials from previous semesters or any other sources of explicit solutions to homework problems.

Solutions to problems are not available to OCW users. However, sample problems with solutions from a previous term are available in the [study materials]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials) section.
